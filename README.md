*DESCRIPTION OF TASK*:The Temperature Monitoring System is a practical and widely used embedded project that continuously measures ambient temperature using a sensor and displays or logs the readings for monitoring and control purposes. It typically involves hardware components such as a microcontroller (like Arduino, ESP32, or Raspberry Pi), a temperature sensor (e.g., LM35, DHT11, or DS18B20), and an output module such as an LCD, 7-segment display, or serial monitor. The system reads analog or digital temperature data from the sensor, processes it through the microcontroller, and converts it into readable temperature values in Celsius or Fahrenheit. Software platforms like Arduino IDE or Python (for Raspberry Pi) are used for coding and communication. This project is applicable in home automation, weather stations, industrial environments, greenhouses, medical equipment, and smart agriculture where temperature regulation is crucial. It helps users understand sensor interfacing, analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), data display, and real-time monitoring. The system can also be extended to include alert notifications, data logging to SD cards or cloud platforms, and even IoT integration for remote access. This makes it a valuable beginner-to-intermediate level project for showcasing practical skills in embedded systems, sensor networks, and IoT development on GitHub.
